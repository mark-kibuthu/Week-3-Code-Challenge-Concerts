# Concert Management System

This project is a simple concert management system using SQLAlchemy and SQLite. It models bands, venues, and concerts, and provides methods for querying and managing these entities.

## Features

- **Band**: Represents a musical band with methods to manage concerts and venues.
- **Venue**: Represents a concert venue with methods to find bands and concerts.
- **Concert**: Represents a concert, linking a band and a venue on a specific date.


## Setup Instructions
1. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install sqlalchemy alembic
    ```
2. Run the migrations:
    ```
    alembic upgrade head
    ```

## Usage
- Create a new band:
    ```python
    band = Band(name="The Beatles", hometown="Liverpool")
    ```
- Create a concert:
    ```python
    concert = band.play_in_venue(venue, "2024-12-31")
    ```
Run the test script to verify that the models and methods work as expected:

bash

python test_script.py

This script creates a band, a venue, and a concert, then tests various methods to ensure they work correctly.
