# Create a band and a venue

# Play a concert

# Test methods

# Expected output: [<Band(name='The Rolling Stones', hometown='London')>]

# Test Venue's concert_on method
print("Concert on '2024-12-31':", venue.concert_on("2024-12-31"))  
# Expected output: <Concert(date='2024-12-31', band_id=..., venue_id=...)>

# Test Band's most_performances method
print("Band with most performances:", Band.most_performances(session))  
# Expected output: <Band(name='The Rolling Stones', hometown='London')> or None if no band

# Test Venue's most_frequent_band method
print("Most frequent band at venue:", venue.most_frequent_band())
